<div class="title">Persistent Volumes</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most Applications require the ability to store information that persists after they are gone. With the approach that OpenShift and Kubernetes have to Applications, which is that they should really be able to be destroyed and recreated, this causes some issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have an Application running as a Pod and, say, the Node on which it is running goes down, then OpenShift will automatically recreate it somewhere within the Cluster. This recreation is done from the Image, along with things such as Config Maps and Secrets which can change files in the Container and Environment variables. But the Application cannot change these things, the image containing the filesystem or the provided Config Maps and Secrets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenShift provides the concept of 'Persistent Volumes'. These are filesystems expressed as directories into the Container on creation but actually stored away from the Container - this means the Application can use the filesystem as with any filesystem but the contents remain in the volume when the Container is removed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means wherever the Container is hosted within the Cluster it has the Persisted Volume attached, which means that the data in that volume can survive loss of the Application.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we will add a Persistent Volume to the Application. To do this we need to change the Deployment Config of the Application - this defines how the Application is orchestrated within OpenShift</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Switch to the Administrator viewpoint by clicking on Developer at the top left and select Administrator. Open the Deployment Configs tab by clicking on Workloads/Deployment Configs (not deployments - these are the Kubernetes deployment objects that are a less functional way of deploying an Application).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There should be one DC listed with the name 'nodeatomic'. Click on the name to get the Deployment Config Details tab. This shows the number of active Pods and information about the deployment config</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now select the Action menu at the top right and choose 'Add Storage'</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Persisent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenShift implements storage using three distinct objects:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Persistent Volumes (PV)</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are the actual physical storage units. With storage providers that don&#8217;t have dynamic storage provision these units are pre-created and can then be assigned to a deployment config (which represents the Application) using the next object, the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC). When a PV is created, be it in advance or dynamically, you can configure the retention strategy. This is 'retain' or 'delete'. With a 'delete' strategy when <strong>all</strong> references to the PV are removed (i.e. PVCs, deployments and the like) the storage unit is physically deleted. With 'retain' the file contents of the PV remain - this is for the case where you want to remove all of the application footprint from the cluster but want to retain its data for later recreation. In this case the PV remains unbounded.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When an Application claims a PV (or has one created dynamically) the PVC defines how the PV is expressed into the Application. You can think of this as the configuration for the application&#8217;s use of the filesystem. The PVC defines, for example. the access mode. This is discussed in detail later in the lab.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Storage Class (SC)</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenShift administrators and storage providers can setup RBAC defined classes which are a template for creating PVs and PVCs. This is to allow multiple levels of storage types and control who can use them - for instance you could have a 'SLOW' storage class that assigned to less powerful storage and had a fixed size.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we will add a PVC to our application - at the 'Add Storage' tab you will see a heading for 'Persistent Volume Claim'. We haven&#8217;t created a claim so click the select box for 'Create new claim'</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This workshop runs on AWS: From the Storage Class dropdown select the class called 'gp2'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The screen should look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="pvs-4.png" alt="create new claim">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Persistent Volume Claim Name type 'nodeatomicclaim'</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now look at the Access Mode. This is very important. With AWS EBS you only have the option of RWO and this should be preselected.</p>

<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Persistent Volume Access Modes</p>

</ol>

<div class="sidebarblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenShift supports three distinct modes for storage behaviours and these are very important.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Single User (RWO)</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the storage is set to RWO this creates a single copy of the storage. This storage is assigned and mounted onto the <strong>first</strong> Node where an Application lands - if you have multiple copies of the Application and they are on separate Nodes the first one will get the storage and the subsequent ones will <strong>not</strong> be able to start up.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Shared Access (RWX)</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This type of storage is <strong>singular</strong> across the Cluster. This means that all copies of the Application will have access to the <strong>same</strong> piece of storage. This is very useful but currently only supported if the storage mechanism is NFS or Azure Disk.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Read Only (ROX)</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This type of storage is <strong>singular</strong> across the Cluster but is read only.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Set the size of the PVC to 1GB (enter 1 in the textbox and leave the units as GiB)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Set the Mount Path to '/labs/storage'</p>

Be very careful with the mount point. You can overwrite existing files and directories in the Container image. If you use subpath you can actually spoof the Container (i.e. inject your own executables). This is a powerful feature by design.

<p><strong>Click 'Save'</strong></p>

<p>The interface will shift to the Deployment Config Details and a deployment will automatically start. This is because we have physically changed the deployment config and by default OpenShift will automatically redeploy if the configuration of the deployment <strong>or</strong> the image that is used for the deployment are changed</p>

<p>Once the deployment has finished and one Pod is displayed, click on the 'Pods' tab of the Deployment Config Details tab. There should be one pod and it should be called something like 'nodeatomic-2-zzzzz' (the '2' indicates the version of the deployment). Click on the Pod name.</p>

<p>What we are going to do now is remove the Application. Instead of deleting the Pod, and having OpenShift automatically recreate it, we are going to scale the deployment down to zero replicas, which will get rid of the Application completely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Switch back to the Developer view (click on Administrator and choose Developer). Make sure the Topology is showing and click on the node Pod. When the Deployment tab appears on the right-hand side, click on the Details tab.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This displays the overview of the Deployment Config. You will see a representation of the Application shown as a Pod with the number 1 in the middle. Next to the icon are two arrows - these are used to scale up and down the number of replicas. Click on the down arrow and set the replicas for the Application to zero.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now click on Developer and switch back to the Adminstrator view. On the left hand menu click on Storage/Persistent Volume Claims. You will see the PVC is still bound even though we have no replicas of the Application. It remains resident at this point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Switch back to the Developer view. In the Topology click on the empty node. In the Deployment Config tab click on Details. You will see the 'scale down' arrow is grayed out because we have no replicas. Scale the count back up to 1 (make sure you only scale to 1 at this point).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the Pod has started (dark blue circle) click on Resources. You will see a new Pod has spun up (it will have a different set of five letters at the end of the Pod). Click on the Pod name.</p>
